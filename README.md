## About

The portfolio showcases my game design concepts and projects with detailed descriptions and visuals.

**You can click on each card to open a custom page per each project.**

The **Menu button** will answer many questions, provide links, let you view my Resume/CV, socials, contact, etc.

The visual shell was built with pure HTML and CSS using Claude Code with extensive prompt engineering, but the actual content/designs were hand-made by my human self. These are game concepts I put many days/weeks/months of thought and care into. I really want to make these games a reality.

## Opportunity for you, Coder
If you find them inspiring and cool, join me up as a coder where I will handle art, sound, music, design, project management, marketing, publishing and you will handle the code, whether you use AI coding tools or hand-made code or a hybrid approach - all are welcome.

(pick a project, tell me what you can do, and we can strike a team to tackle it together as an online introvert team with no deadlines or pressures, focusing on making the project the best it can be within our combined skill)

## Employer, you can hire me
You can hire me for game design consulting work if you need someone with a keen eye for game design expertise.
