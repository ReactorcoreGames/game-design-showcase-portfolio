Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Collidotron:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle shot of a pristine crystalline processing chamber with geometric lattice patterns embedded in translucent walls, subtle energy flows pulsing through the chamber's veins, a central platform holding a kaleidoscopic slab ready for processing, titanium framework gleaming under soft industrial lighting, precision machinery details visible in the background, hexagonal grid patterns creating depth and structure throughout the scene. Futuristic industrial photography, clean minimalist aesthetic, precise geometric forms, soft volumetric lighting, crystalline textures, high-tech materials. Sharp blue-teal color theme with white titanium accents and energy glow effects.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Medium shot capturing the exact moment of cascade initiation, luminous orbs ricocheting through a fracturing crystalline lattice structure, geometric patterns breaking apart in precise mathematical formations, trails of energy following each orb's trajectory, fragments of crystal suspended mid-air with light refracting through them, the scene frozen at the peak moment of controlled demolition showing both order and chaos. Cinematic physics visualization, motion blur on moving elements, particle effects, scientific precision, dynamic energy flows, crystalline fragmentation patterns. Sharp blue-teal color theme with white titanium accents and energy glow effects.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Close-up slow-motion intervention scene showing a single reaction orb surrounded by trajectory prediction lines and targeting overlays, time distortion effects visible around the orb, strategic interface elements displaying optimal path calculations, crystalline slab tiles partially broken in the background, precision targeting reticle highlighting the perfect redirection point, scientific overlay data suggesting tactical decision-making. Technical visualization photography, heads-up display aesthetics, slow-motion time effects, precision targeting interface, scientific overlays, strategic planning visualization. Sharp blue-teal color theme with white titanium accents and energy glow effects.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Portrait view of the complete Collidotron processing machine as sophisticated industrial equipment, kaleidoscopic crystalline slab being loaded into the chamber mechanism, precise mechanical arms and processing apparatus visible, geometric patterns reflecting through transparent processing windows, elegant titanium framework housing the entire system, technical readouts and displays showing operational status, industrial beauty meeting scientific precision. Industrial equipment photography, precision machinery aesthetics, high-tech materials, sophisticated engineering design, clean industrial lines, professional equipment visualization. Sharp blue-teal color theme with white titanium accents and energy glow effects.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Expansive aerial view of Neo-Geneva's sprawling industrial complex stretching to the horizon, multiple Collidotron processing facilities integrated into the cityscape, layers of geological strata visible in exposed quarry sections showing lithified landfill deposits, futuristic city towers rising from reclaimed materials, atmospheric perspective showing the massive scale of environmental restoration, subtle energy networks connecting processing centers across the landscape. Epic sci-fi cityscape photography, atmospheric depth, massive scale architecture, environmental restoration themes, geological layering, industrial megastructures. Sharp blue-teal color theme with white titanium accents and energy glow effects.
