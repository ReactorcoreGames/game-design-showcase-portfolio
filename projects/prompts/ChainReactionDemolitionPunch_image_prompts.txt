Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Chain Reaction Demolition Punch:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle cinematic shot from low ground level, looking up at a muscular one-eyed humanoid figure in construction worker clothing and hard hat, positioned mid-stance preparing to deliver a powerful punch toward a towering concrete office building. The cyclops hero has weathered work clothes with reflective safety strips, massive fists, and a determined expression. Behind him stretches a cityscape of geometric building silhouettes against a dusky sky. His single eye glows with inner energy as heat distortion ripples around his clenched fist. Dramatic dynamic lighting, industrial photography aesthetic, realistic textures with stylized proportions, explosive energy effects, ember particle trails. Deep crimson-burgundy color palette with charcoal blacks and bright orange accents.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Extreme close-up macro photography capturing the precise moment of impact between glowing fist and concrete wall, frozen in time with stone fragments exploding outward in a perfect sphere pattern. Heat trails streak through the air like molten ribbons while chunks of debris follow curved trajectories. The blast epicenter shows white-hot energy spreading through visible stress fractures in the building material. Secondary heat blooms cascade from the initial impact point creating a chain reaction of glowing destruction. Telephoto lens compression, high-speed photography freeze-frame, particle physics visualization. Dramatic dynamic lighting, industrial photography aesthetic, realistic textures with stylized proportions, explosive energy effects, ember particle trails. Deep crimson-burgundy color palette with charcoal blacks and bright orange accents.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Technical cutaway cross-section view showing the interior structure of a multi-story building during demolition, with glowing heat transfer pathways visible as bright orange veins spreading through walls and support beams. Temperature gradients flow in realistic patterns from the blast point, with cooler blue zones transitioning to yellow, orange, and white-hot areas. Architectural blueprints aesthetic meets thermal imaging visualization, showing both structural elements and energy propagation simultaneously. Scientific diagram style with clean geometric lines and precise technical details. Dramatic dynamic lighting, industrial photography aesthetic, realistic textures with stylized proportions, explosive energy effects, ember particle trails. Deep crimson-burgundy color palette with charcoal blacks and bright orange accents.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Portrait composition featuring the cyclops demolition expert in professional work attire, hard hat, and safety vest, holding a clipboard while standing confidently in front of a modern city skyline. The character has a friendly yet powerful presence with visible construction company logos on their uniform. Behind them, partially demolished buildings showcase their handiwork with controlled precision. Professional business portrait lighting with subtle heroic undertones, corporate headshot style meets superhero poster design. Clean professional aesthetic with subtle hints of destructive power lurking beneath the surface. Dramatic dynamic lighting, industrial photography aesthetic, realistic textures with stylized proportions, explosive energy effects, ember particle trails. Deep crimson-burgundy color palette with charcoal blacks and bright orange accents.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Elevated aerial view of a sprawling metropolitan area showing the broader urban environment where demolition contracts take place. The cityscape features a mix of modern skyscrapers, older industrial buildings, residential areas, and construction zones scattered throughout. Various structures show different stages of demolition work in progress, with some buildings intact, others partially deconstructed, and cleared lots ready for new development. City planning aesthetic with clear districts and infrastructure visible from above, emphasizing the scope and scale of the demolition business operations across the urban landscape. Dramatic dynamic lighting, industrial photography aesthetic, realistic textures with stylized proportions, explosive energy effects, ember particle trails. Deep crimson-burgundy color palette with charcoal blacks and bright orange accents.
