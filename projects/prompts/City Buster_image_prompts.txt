Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Orbital City Buster:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle orbital view showing sleek metallic paddle warship hovering above sprawling futuristic city with towering skyscrapers, industrial complexes, and glowing infrastructure spread across geometric districts. Ship features angular design with energy weapon arrays pointed downward, positioned in dark space with planet curvature visible. City below shows detailed urban planning with roads, bridges, and varied building heights creating complex skyline ready for destruction. Atmospheric perspective with subtle lighting gradients from orbital darkness to illuminated cityscape below. Cinematic space photography, dramatic lighting, highly detailed mechanical design, realistic materials, sleek sci-fi aesthetic, industrial textures. Deep teal-cyan color scheme with bright red energy accents and metallic green highlights.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Medium shot capturing moment of explosive impact as energy orbs strike city buildings, showing cascading destruction with realistic physics debris flying outward. Concrete structures mid-collapse with chunks of masonry and rebar tumbling through air, glass windows shattering in crystalline sprays, fires erupting from impact zones spreading orange flames across building surfaces. Secondary explosions creating chain reactions through adjacent structures while smoke and dust clouds billow upward. Dynamic action freeze-frame with multiple destruction events occurring simultaneously across frame. Cinematic space photography, dramatic lighting, highly detailed mechanical design, realistic materials, sleek sci-fi aesthetic, industrial textures. Deep teal-cyan color scheme with bright red energy accents and metallic green highlights.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Close-up macro view of falling sand physics simulation showing individual particles transforming through heat and kinetic force. Sand grains melting into molten glass droplets while concrete fragments shatter into smaller aggregate pieces, wooden debris igniting into flickering flames and ash particles. Material transformation happening in real-time with visible heat distortion effects, particle trails, and gravitational flow patterns. Physics-based interaction between different material types creating cascading chain reactions of transformation and movement through detailed micro-environment. Cinematic space photography, dramatic lighting, highly detailed mechanical design, realistic materials, sleek sci-fi aesthetic, industrial textures. Deep teal-cyan color scheme with bright red energy accents and metallic green highlights.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Dramatic low-angle hero shot of imposing paddle warship dominating frame as ultimate weapon of destruction, massive angular hull with glowing red energy weapon systems activated and charging. Ship positioned against starfield background with city lights visible on planet surface far below, emphasizing scale and orbital superiority. Intense red energy crackling along weapon arrays with mechanical details showing advanced technology, battle-worn armor plating, and intimidating silhouette. Powerful composition emphasizing destructive capability and technological dominance over urban targets below. Cinematic space photography, dramatic lighting, highly detailed mechanical design, realistic materials, sleek sci-fi aesthetic, industrial textures. Deep teal-cyan color scheme with bright red energy accents and metallic green highlights.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Sweeping panoramic view of entire star system showing multiple planets with different industrial settlements, space stations, and orbital infrastructure connected by shipping lanes and energy conduits. Fifty star systems of contested frontier territory with various worlds displaying signs of corruption, criminal activity, and vigilante intervention. Some planets show peaceful colonies while others display battle damage, burning cities, and defensive installations. Network of travel routes between systems with patrol ships and cargo vessels creating sense of active galactic civilization in conflict. Epic space opera scale establishing the broader Helios Sector setting. Cinematic space photography, dramatic lighting, highly detailed mechanical design, realistic materials, sleek sci-fi aesthetic, industrial textures. Deep teal-cyan color scheme with bright red energy accents and metallic green highlights.
