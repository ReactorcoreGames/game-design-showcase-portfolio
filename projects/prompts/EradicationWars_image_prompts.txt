Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Vast stellar sector map showing interconnected star systems linked by jumpgate networks across multiple regions. Ancient orbital colonies and industrial space stations dot the starscape while massive fleet formations patrol between systems. Two distinct civilizations occupy opposite sides of the sector with their territories clearly marked by different architectural styles and lighting colors. The central neutral zones show signs of ongoing conflict with debris fields and damaged structures. Multiple star clusters are labeled as different worlds - industrial sectors, border regions, and core territories. The scale emphasizes the galaxy-spanning nature of the eradication war with billions of lives at stake across dozens of star systems. dark sci-fi mecha art, dramatic orange lighting, high contrast shadows, detailed mechanical designs, gritty textures, industrial aesthetics, explosive effects
