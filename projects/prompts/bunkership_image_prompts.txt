Energy projectiles streak across the void, illuminating the vessel's brutal architecture. Explosions bloom from exhaust ports as internal systems cascade into failure. The rocky hull contrasts against star-filled darkness while defensive fire creates brilliant light trails. Industrial sci-fi concept art, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, photorealistic digital painting, highly detailed textures, cinematic composition, volumetric lighting effects, particle systems. Dark purple-teal color scheme with bright metallic accents and energy weapon glows.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Extreme close-up tactical shot focusing on a spherical energy orb approaching a bunkership's exhaust port opening. The projectile glows with electrical energy while the ship's rocky surface shows battle damage and defensive systems. Camera positioned at projectile level, shallow depth of field blurring background details. The exhaust port's interior machinery is partially visible, suggesting vulnerability. Nearby turret systems track the incoming threat. Sharp angular rock formations frame the composition.
