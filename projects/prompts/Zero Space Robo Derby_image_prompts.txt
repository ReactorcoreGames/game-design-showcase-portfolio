Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Zero Space Robo Derby:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle cinematic shot from medium distance showing a rectangular zero-gravity arena in deep space. Two sleek custom robot ships drift in opposing positions, one charging a glowing weapon while the other maneuvers around floating asteroid chunks. The arena has translucent energy barriers containing the battle zone. Debris and previous particle explosions create a dynamic atmosphere with glowing trails frozen in motion. Digital art, neon cyberpunk aesthetic, particle simulation effects, holographic lighting, futuristic robot design, metallic surfaces with energy glows. Deep purple space backgrounds with bright magenta energy weapons and violet particle trails.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Close-up dynamic action shot capturing the moment of ship destruction, focused on a robot ship exploding into spectacular cellular automata particles. The explosion creates a beautiful cascade of colorful pixels that behave like living fireworks - some particles drift slowly while others move in complex patterns. Enemy ship visible in background firing the killing shot. The destruction feels celebratory rather than violent, with rainbow-like particle systems creating organic, flowing patterns. Digital art, neon cyberpunk aesthetic, particle simulation effects, holographic lighting, futuristic robot design, metallic surfaces with energy glows. Deep purple space backgrounds with bright magenta energy weapons and violet particle trails.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Extreme close-up macro shot of cellular automata destruction in progress, showing individual pixels behaving as autonomous agents. Each particle glows with unique colors and follows physics-based movement patterns. Some pixels cluster together forming temporary structures while others spread out in organic waves. The destruction pattern resembles both fireworks and living organisms, with intricate detail visible in each particle's behavior and interaction with nearby elements. Digital art, neon cyberpunk aesthetic, particle simulation effects, holographic lighting, futuristic robot design, metallic surfaces with energy glows. Deep purple space backgrounds with bright magenta energy weapons and violet particle trails.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Establishing wide shot of a massive orbital space station community floating among asteroid fields. Multiple docking bays house various spacecraft while specialized arena platforms extend from the main structure. The station has a lived-in, frontier settlement appearance with practical industrial design mixed with community spaces. Distant robot ships can be seen moving between docking areas. The scene conveys a thriving frontier colony where these celebrations are central to community life. Digital art, neon cyberpunk aesthetic, particle simulation effects, holographic lighting, futuristic robot design, metallic surfaces with energy glows. Deep purple space backgrounds with bright magenta energy weapons and violet particle trails.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Portrait-oriented heroic composition featuring a customized robot ship in the foreground, angled dramatically toward the viewer. The ship has unique decorative elements and glowing weapon systems. Behind it, a spectacular fireworks display of cellular automata particles creates an explosive celebration backdrop. Other ships are silhouetted against the particle display. The composition emphasizes both the mechanical precision of the ships and the organic beauty of the destruction effects. Digital art, neon cyberpunk aesthetic, particle simulation effects, holographic lighting, futuristic robot design, metallic surfaces with energy glows. Deep purple space backgrounds with bright magenta energy weapons and violet particle trails.
