Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Unhinged Lander Heist:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide establishing shot, low-angle view through atmospheric haze. A weathered space lander with glowing plasma thrusters approaches an imposing lunar research facility built into crater walls. Massive industrial structures with defensive turrets and glowing containment chambers dominate the stark landscape. Security spotlights sweep across geometric concrete bunkers while warning lights pulse ominously. The facility's modular architecture suggests corporate efficiency hiding dangerous secrets. Moody atmospheric lighting, gritty industrial sci-fi aesthetic, detailed mechanical textures, dramatic shadows, cinematic composition. Neon cyan-green color scheme with deep space blues and metallic silver accents.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Medium shot, third-person perspective in pixel art style. An armored operative with glowing jetpack navigates through narrow industrial corridors lined with exposed pipes and ventilation systems. Sleek guard drones with red scanning beams patrol overhead while plasma bolts streak past. The character moves with tactical precision between cover points, their plasma shotgun ready. Facility walls show corporate branding and hazard warnings. Emergency lighting casts harsh shadows. Moody atmospheric lighting, gritty industrial sci-fi aesthetic, detailed mechanical textures, dramatic shadows, cinematic composition. Neon cyan-green color scheme with deep space blues and metallic silver accents.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Dramatic aerial view, wide-angle lens capturing spectacular destruction. Cellular automata patterns in vibrant chaotic colors spread like living organisms across a residential district. The destruction moves in organic waves, consuming buildings in fractal patterns that shift between mathematical precision and wild chaos. Structures dissolve into cascading particle systems while maintaining recognizable urban geometry. The automata creates beautiful yet terrifying patterns of consumption and transformation. Moody atmospheric lighting, gritty industrial sci-fi aesthetic, detailed mechanical textures, dramatic shadows, cinematic composition. Neon cyan-green color scheme with deep space blues and metallic silver accents.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Dynamic close-up portrait, slight low-angle hero shot. An unhinged operative in battle-scarred armor holds glowing anomalous canisters, their face partially obscured by tactical visor reflecting chaotic destruction. Behind them, cellular automata patterns consume a corporate facility in spectacular fashion. The character's pose suggests both triumph and dangerous instability. Scattered debris and energy effects frame the composition. Their equipment shows improvised modifications and battle damage. Moody atmospheric lighting, gritty industrial sci-fi aesthetic, detailed mechanical textures, dramatic shadows, cinematic composition. Neon cyan-green color scheme with deep space blues and metallic silver accents.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Sweeping orbital view, satellite perspective of lunar surface. Multiple corporate mining facilities dot crater floors connected by transport tubes and supply lines. The main research complex appears as a sprawling industrial infection on the pristine lunar landscape. Other smaller outposts and mining operations create a network of human intrusion. Earth hangs in the star-filled void above, distant and uncaring. The scene suggests corporate expansion and environmental exploitation on a grand scale. Moody atmospheric lighting, gritty industrial sci-fi aesthetic, detailed mechanical textures, dramatic shadows, cinematic composition. Neon cyan-green color scheme with deep space blues and metallic silver accents.
