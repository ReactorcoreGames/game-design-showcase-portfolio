Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Planetary Ring Miner:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle cinematic shot from below, industrial mining vessel suspended in exotic asteroid ring around massive alien planet. Ship features angular hull with upward-facing weapon arrays, glowing energy conduits, and collection bay doors. Asteroid ring stretches across frame with varied exotic materials - crystalline formations, metallic chunks, gas-dispersing fragments. Planet looms in background with swirling atmospheric storms and ring shadow patterns. Ship positioned off-center with dynamic lighting from dual star system. Mystical sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, cosmic atmosphere, highly detailed mechanical design, ethereal glow effects. Deep purple-magenta color scheme with bright cyan-green accents and metallic silver highlights.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Close-up dynamic action shot, asteroid destruction mid-explosion with exotic particle cascade. Crystalline chunks transforming into flowing liquid streams and gas clouds with realistic physics. Energy weapon blast point creating radial shockwave through exotic materials. Debris falling like sand particles with different densities - heavy metallic pieces, lightweight crystal shards, dispersing vapor clouds. Motion blur on fastest particles, sharp focus on transformation moment. Sparks and energy residue trailing through space. Mystical sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, cosmic atmosphere, highly detailed mechanical design, ethereal glow effects. Deep purple-magenta color scheme with bright cyan-green accents and metallic silver highlights.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Bird's eye view star map displaying interconnected civilization network. Multiple star systems connected by glowing trade routes, orbital stations, research facilities, and defensive outposts. Central hub with radiating pathways to frontier worlds. Infrastructure grows from basic mining outposts to sprawling megastructures. Visual progression showing development stages across different sectors. Holographic display aesthetic with detailed space architecture. Strategic overview perspective with visible resource flow indicators and expansion patterns. Mystical sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, cosmic atmosphere, highly detailed mechanical design, ethereal glow effects. Deep purple-magenta color scheme with bright cyan-green accents and metallic silver highlights.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Dramatic low-angle hero shot, mining ship silhouette against colorful exoplanet backdrop. Vessel positioned prominently in lower third with weapon systems visible, angular industrial design emphasized. Exotic planetary rings create sweeping arcs across composition with varied asteroid materials catching light. Alien world dominates upper portion with atmospheric storms, ring shadows, and distant binary stars. Ship's energy systems glowing against darker foreground. Dynamic diagonal composition with strong contrast between ship and cosmic environment. Mystical sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, cosmic atmosphere, highly detailed mechanical design, ethereal glow effects. Deep purple-magenta color scheme with bright cyan-green accents and metallic silver highlights.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
