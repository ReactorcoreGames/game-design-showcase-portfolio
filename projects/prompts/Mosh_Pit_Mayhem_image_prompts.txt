Here are the four detailed image generation prompts for Mosh Pit Mayhem:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide cinematic shot from elevated angle showing a massive metal concert stage with towering amplifier stacks, blazing stage lights cutting through smoke-filled air, and silhouetted metalheads with long hair headbanging in an intense moshpit below. The stage features a heavy metal band performing, with the vocalist screaming into the mic, guitarist shredding, and drummer pounding beats. Crowd surfers fly overhead while bodies slam together in organized chaos. Steam and sweat mist rises from the packed venue. Gritty concert photography, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, photorealistic textures, high contrast shadows, motion blur effects, particle sparks from pyrotechnics. Dark black backdrop with blood-red stage lights, golden spotlights, electric purple hues, and bright white strobes.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Close-up dynamic action shot capturing two ragdoll-style metalheads in mid-air collision during peak moshpit chaos. Bodies contorted with realistic physics showing momentum transfer, limbs flailing, long hair whipping through the air. One figure leads with shoulder while the other protects with arms crossed. Blood droplets and sweat spray frozen in motion around the impact zone. Background shows blurred crowd and stage lights creating bokeh effects. Sharp focus on the collision point with motion trails following body movement. Kinetic sports photography, freeze-frame capture, hyper-detailed anatomy, dramatic motion blur, ethereal particle trails, realistic physics simulation. Deep crimson blood effects against jet black environment, electric blue motion trails, bright white impact flashes, and golden sweat highlights.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Medium shot showcasing momentum-based combat mechanics with a metalhead launching off arena walls using wall-assisted boost technique. The figure ricochets at high velocity toward opponents, body positioned tactically with arms extended for impact. Mystical relics glow with supernatural energy scattered across the battle arena floor. Wall shows impact fractures and blood stains from previous collisions. Physics particles and energy trails emphasize speed and force multipliers. Arena lighting creates dramatic shadows and highlights muscle definition and tactical positioning. Dynamic action photography, superhero cinematography, enhanced particle effects, volumetric lighting, tactical positioning emphasis. Rich purple relic glow against charcoal arena walls, bright red velocity trails, electric blue wall-boost energy, and golden power-up auras.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Vertical concert poster composition featuring a heavy metal band on stage at the top with massive crowd and moshpit battle scene below. Stage shows performers in silhouette against blazing spotlights with smoke machines creating atmosphere. Lower portion depicts ragdoll metalheads engaged in physics-based combat with bodies flying, colliding, and dismembering in controlled chaos. Arena floor stained with battle marks and scattered mystical relics. Concert venue architecture frames the scene with industrial metal structures. Classic metal album cover art, poster illustration style, balanced composition, detailed crowd scenes, atmospheric perspective. Dominant black background with crimson stage lighting, electric purple accent colors, bright white spotlight beams, and golden concert atmosphere.
