Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Tile Mechs:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide establishing shot, low angle perspective, cinematic framing of a massive humanoid Type-3 mecha standing dominantly in the center of a tactical grid battlefield. The mech features sleek angular armor plating with articulated manipulator arms holding modular weapons, glowing blue reactor core visible through chest panels. Surrounding tactical grid tiles show burn scars, glass formations, and lava craters from previous combat. Smoke and atmospheric haze drift across the scene while debris and destroyed conventional mecha litter the background terrain. Photorealistic military sci-fi rendering, sharp mechanical details, volumetric lighting effects, particle atmospherics, dynamic combat aftermath. Dark military green-blue color scheme with electric blue reactor glows and orange environmental fire accents.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Medium shot, tactical overhead angle showing real-time grid combat in action. Type-3 mecha mid-stride on tactical grid tiles, weapon arm extended firing a bright energy beam toward off-screen targets. Grid overlay visible with movement buffering indicators and tactical UI elements. Environmental destruction actively occurring - grass burning to ash in spreading patterns, sand transforming to reflective glass surfaces, explosive craters forming molten lava pools. Debris and projectile trails streak through the frame with motion blur effects. Photorealistic military sci-fi rendering, sharp mechanical details, volumetric lighting effects, particle atmospherics, dynamic combat aftermath. Dark military green-blue color scheme with electric blue reactor glows and orange environmental fire accents.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Close-up dramatic angle, environmental transformation sequence showing terrain metamorphosis from normal battlefield to scarred wasteland. Left side shows pristine grass and natural terrain, center displays active transformation with fire spreading and plasma impacts, right side reveals the aftermath - blackened ash, crystallized glass formations, and solidified obsidian craters. Type-3 mecha silhouette visible in background amid the destruction, weapon discharge illuminating the scene. Progressive environmental states demonstrate permanent battlefield scarring and consequence. Photorealistic military sci-fi rendering, sharp mechanical details, volumetric lighting effects, particle atmospherics, dynamic combat aftermath. Dark military green-blue color scheme with electric blue reactor glows and orange environmental fire accents.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Heroic low angle shot, dramatic portrait framing of Type-3 mecha in imposing combat stance. Mech positioned prominently in foreground with articulated arms crossed, holding different weapon configurations, chest reactor core blazing with blue energy. Background shows tactical grid battlefield with environmental destruction and moral consequence themes - half showing precise surgical strikes with minimal damage, half showing overwhelming destructive aftermath. Atmospheric lighting creates strong contrast between light and shadow, emphasizing the duality of power and responsibility. Photorealistic military sci-fi rendering, sharp mechanical details, volumetric lighting effects, particle atmospherics, dynamic combat aftermath. Dark military green-blue color scheme with electric blue reactor glows and orange environmental fire accents.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Extreme wide shot, satellite view perspective showing vast conflict zones across planetary surface. Multiple tactical grid battlefields visible as geometric patterns scattered across diverse terrain - urban centers, industrial complexes, natural landscapes, each bearing unique scars from Type-3 intervention. Conventional forces represented as smaller formations moving toward conflict zones while isolated Type-3 mechs appear as bright tactical markers. Atmospheric haze and weather patterns add scale while news overlay graphics suggest media coverage and reputation tracking systems monitoring the conflicts. Photorealistic military sci-fi rendering, sharp mechanical details, volumetric lighting effects, particle atmospherics, dynamic combat aftermath. Dark military green-blue color scheme with electric blue reactor glows and orange environmental fire accents.
