Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Spacelancer:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle cinematic shot of an epic space battle with multiple spacecraft types engaged in intense combat around a massive asteroid field. The main focal point is a sleek freelancer vessel in the foreground firing energy beams, surrounded by explosions and debris. Secondary elements include various ship classes - fighters, corvettes, and capital ships - engaged in tactical formations with weapons fire streaking across the scene. Background shows a nebula with distant stars and floating asteroids creating depth. Cinematic digital art, dramatic lighting with strong contrasts, science fiction aesthetic, futuristic spaceship designs, particle effects, lens flares. Deep navy-blue space backdrop with bright cyan energy beams and purple nebula accents, metallic silver ship hulls.

Vignette Image: (16:9) 
Close-up dynamic shot of a sleek combat spacecraft mid-transformation from streamlined flight mode to tactical shipmech configuration. The camera captures the mechanical transformation sequence from a three-quarter angle, showing extending wing segments, rotating weapon hardpoints, and reconfiguring thruster arrays. The ship features modular design elements with visible hardpoint systems. Secondary details include energy trails from the transformation process and space background with distant stars. Technical blueprint aesthetic mixed with cinematic realism, mechanical precision, detailed hard-surface modeling, glowing panel indicators. Navy-blue hull plating with cyan transformation energy effects, purple accent lighting on active systems, white status indicators.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Detailed overhead view of a spacecraft's modular hardpoint customization interface showing the ship's weapon mounting system. The main subject is a medium-class vessel displayed in a technical schematic style with various hardpoint sizes (small, medium, large) clearly visible along the hull. Secondary elements include floating weapon modules - energy cannons, ballistic guns, missile pods, and utility equipment - positioned around the ship showing potential configurations. Background features a clean technical interface environment. Technical illustration style, blueprint aesthetics, clean vector graphics, isometric perspective, UI design elements, glowing connection points. Dark navy interface background with bright cyan hardpoint indicators, purple weapon system highlights, white technical annotations.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Heroic low-angle shot of a lone freelancer spacecraft silhouetted against a massive, colorful nebula with a distant orbital space station visible in the background. The ship is positioned as the central heroic figure, angled upward and to the right suggesting movement and aspiration. The nebula dominates the upper portion with swirling cosmic clouds, while the space station provides scale and civilization context. Dramatic poster composition with strong silhouette contrast and atmospheric depth. Epic space opera poster art, heroic composition, dramatic silhouettes, cinematic scope, romantic idealism, painterly nebula textures. Deep navy space with brilliant cyan and purple nebula clouds, silhouetted ship in dark contrast, white station lights in distance.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Sweeping wide panoramic view of the Andromeda frontier showing a vast star field with multiple connected star systems, glowing trade routes, and distinct faction territories. The main focus is the cosmic scale view with visible hyperspace lanes connecting different stellar regions. Secondary elements include various space installations, orbital platforms, and different colored regions indicating faction control zones. The composition suggests exploration, opportunity, and the vastness of civilized space. Grand strategy game map aesthetic, cosmic overview perspective, network visualization, territorial boundaries, exploration themes. Deep navy space background with cyan hyperspace trade routes, purple faction territory markers, white star clusters and installations.

Unified Art Style (for all five, already included in prompts):
Cinematic digital art, dramatic lighting with strong contrasts, science fiction aesthetic, futuristic spaceship designs, particle effects, lens flares. Deep navy-blue space backdrop with bright cyan energy beams and purple nebula accents, metallic silver ship hulls.
