The following prompts have been rewritten to meet all constraints: they feature similar humanoid mecha with rocket boosters facing off, wielding large futuristic rifles, against a hellish dark sky with thermonuclear explosions. Each prompt is condensed by approximately 20%, and the unified art style suffix is applied consistently.



### AAL Eradication Wars: Red vs. Blue Thermonuclear Aerial Conflict

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle cinematic shot of two heavily armored humanoid mechas (Red vs. Blue) locked in brutal mid-air combat. Both mechas face off, both wielding large futuristic rifles. Rocket boosters blaze fiercely as they execute extreme G-force maneuvers against a hellish flaming dark sky. Nuclear explosions erupt in the background, creating massive fireballs above a devastated space colony interior. Colossal facility platforms, colored gritty green, are visible far below.




Vignette Image: (16:9)
Close-up dynamic action shot of a highly mobile Red faction mecha mid-air thrust maneuver, wielding large futuristic rifle. The angular war machine faces off against advancing Blue faction mechas with their back facing towards the viewer. Rocket boosters fire short bursts for rapid evasion. The scarred armor reflects the overwhelming fire of the nuclear storm raging in the hellish dark sky. Structural piping and functional machinery in the ruins are colored gritty green. Spent casings and superheated debris streak through the air.



Feature Image: (16:9)
Medium shot capturing a heavily armored Blue faction mecha (round design) executing a high-G aerial maneuver, turning sharply to face an incoming Red faction unit. The Blue mecha aims its massive futuristic rifle directly at the target. Massive rocket boosters ignite with a blinding flash, providing immense thrust. Red faction mechas attempt pursuit in the background while massive thermal plumes rise into the apocalyptic, fire-scorched sky. Large, grounded supply depots and utility structures show environmental hazard lights glowing a utilitarian, gritty green.
Gritty military sci-fi aesthetics, intense harsh industrial lighting, overwhelming thermonuclear fire aesthetics, high contrast metallic textures, weathered armor plating, visible vernier thruster plumes, explosive particle effects, cinematic depth of field. Brutal red vs blue faction warfare with dark metallic grays, stark white energy bursts, and gritty green environmental decay.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Extreme close-up portrait of a hardened mecha pilot's battle-scarred helmet. The visor reflects the imposed silhouette of an enemy Type-3 war machine (angular Red design) aiming a large futuristic rifle during an extreme high-speed evasion maneuver. The reflection captures the intense, chaotic light and swirling ash of the thermonuclear firestorm under a hellish dark sky. Red and Blue tactical HUD elements illuminate the cockpit interior. Control panel indicators and structural warning lights within the cockpit glow a subtle, gritty green.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Orbital wide-angle view of a contested sector showing massive Red and Blue faction fleet formations deploying highly mobile mecha squadrons. Angular Red mechas and sleek, round Blue mechas are visible in the foreground, facing off in preparation for immediate combat, armed with large futuristic rifles. Shattered planets glow with residual thermonuclear heat and blinding flares against the dark cosmic battlefield. Ancient space station debris and abandoned factory ships show widespread decay, marked by faint, gritty green radiation warnings. The scale emphasizes humanity's reliance on high-speed, highly mobile combat doctrines.
