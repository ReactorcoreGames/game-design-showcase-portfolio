Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Megalodon Firefighter:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle establishing shot from below, dramatic low perspective capturing a massive azure mecha-helicopter emerging from swirling temporal vortex clouds above a burning metropolitan cityscape. The anomalous aircraft features sleek angular armor plating with glowing blue quantum core visible through transparent cockpit sections. Multiple meteorites streak downward as orange flames with trailing smoke columns, burning skyscrapers silhouetted against darkened sky. Debris and ash particles float in the turbulent air. Mecha sci-fi aesthetic, dramatic cinematic lighting, volumetric fog effects, high contrast shadows, dynamic particle systems, glowing energy trails. Deep navy-azure color scheme with bright orange fire accents and metallic silver highlights.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Extreme close-up macro view, 45-degree angled perspective showing cellular automata physics in action as individual water droplets collide with burning wooden beam pixels. Visible material transformation zones where blue water particles sacrifice themselves, extinguishing red-orange fire pixels in real-time cascading reactions. Stone elements transitioning from gray to heated orange as temperature builds. Microscopic detail showing pixel-level material interactions with visible state changes from solid to liquid. Digital particle physics simulation, ultra-detailed texture work, scientific visualization style, crystalline water effects, ember glow particles. Deep navy-azure color scheme with bright orange fire accents and metallic silver highlights.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Medium shot from cockpit interior perspective showing dual weapon systems in detailed view. Left side features high-tech water cannon with transparent blue liquid chambers and pressure gauges, right side displays electromagnetic kinetic autocannon with visible ammunition feed and targeting system. Both weapons aimed toward falling meteorite cluster in distance through reinforced glass. Technical blueprint aesthetics mixed with functional military hardware design. Heads-up display elements visible on glass surfaces. Industrial mecha design, precision engineering details, holographic interface elements, technical schematics overlay, weapon system diagnostics. Deep navy-azure color scheme with bright orange fire accents and metallic silver highlights.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Portrait orientation action shot from low angle showing the azure mecha-helicopter bursting through dimensional portal with energy distortions rippling around its hull. Pilot visible in cockpit wearing tactical gear, gripping controls with determined expression. Background shows multiple timeline fractures as overlapping crisis scenes - burning library, modern city under meteorite bombardment, historical structures ablaze. Temporal energy streams connect different time periods. Dynamic pose with rotors spinning, weapon systems deployed. Epic heroic composition, portal fantasy elements, time travel visual effects, dimensional rifts, heroic poster design. Deep navy-azure color scheme with bright orange fire accents and metallic silver highlights.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Elevated isometric view showing fractured timeline landscape with multiple temporal crisis zones scattered across warped terrain. Each zone contains different historical periods under meteorite attack - ancient structures, medieval towns, modern cities, all connected by shimmering temporal rift pathways. The azure mecha-helicopter moves between zones as guardian figure. Reality tears show glimpses of alternate timelines beneath surface. Map-like overview with strategic mission markers and dimensional portals. Temporal cartography style, dimensional map aesthetics, fantasy strategy game overworld, mystical rift energy, timeline visualization effects. Deep navy-azure color scheme with bright orange fire accents and metallic silver highlights.

Unified Art Style (for all five, already included in prompts): 
Mecha sci-fi aesthetic, dramatic cinematic lighting, volumetric fog effects, high contrast shadows, dynamic particle systems, glowing energy trails. Deep navy-azure color scheme with bright orange fire accents and metallic silver highlights.
