Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Antigrav Deconstruction:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle cinematic shot from below looking up at a massive derelict space station suspended in an antigrav demolition chamber, industrial lights casting dramatic shadows across twisted metal corridors and broken hull plating, floating debris and particle streams creating depth, a sleek demolition drone visible in the lower corner with electromagnetic tether glowing, detailed textures on weathered station components showing years of cosmic wear. Sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, detailed mechanical designs, atmospheric perspective, cinematic composition. Deep purple-magenta gradient background with violet accents and glowing particle trails.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Close-up dynamic shot capturing the exact moment of station module destruction, explosion of hundreds of colorful particles bursting outward in zero gravity, materials separating by type - metallic solids falling down, glowing gases rising up, liquid droplets floating in between, each particle individually visible with unique colors and textures, electromagnetic ball visible at impact point creating energy ripples, satisfying cascade of debris flowing in all directions like cosmic confetti. Sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, detailed mechanical designs, atmospheric perspective, cinematic composition. Deep purple-magenta gradient background with violet accents and glowing particle trails.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Medium shot showing elemental ball creating chain reactions between different colored station materials, fire-type ball causing thermal expansion in red metal sections, electric arcs jumping between conductive blue components, acid spreading green corrosion across hull plates, particles beginning their transformation sequences as they collide, visible chemistry happening in real-time, gravitational fields indicated by particle flow patterns, demolition drone maneuvering to create localized gravity well. Sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, detailed mechanical designs, atmospheric perspective, cinematic composition. Deep purple-magenta gradient background with violet accents and glowing particle trails.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Portrait composition showing demolition specialist's sleek spacecraft in heroic three-quarter view angle, electromagnetic tethered ball glowing with elemental energy, space station debris field scattered in background creating depth, particle streams forming cosmic patterns around the vessel, dramatic upward lighting emphasizing the therapeutic yet powerful nature of controlled demolition, detailed spacecraft hull with visible technology panels and particle collection systems, sense of zen mastery over chaotic destruction. Sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, detailed mechanical designs, atmospheric perspective, cinematic composition. Deep purple-magenta gradient background with violet accents and glowing particle trails.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Vast establishing shot of the Stellar Reclamation Zones showing multiple derelict stations floating in organized demolition sectors, distant civilization starships constructed from reclaimed materials traveling between sectors, cosmic graveyard atmosphere with beautiful nebula formations in background, sense of scale showing the endless cycle of renewal through destruction, therapeutic demolition chambers visible as glowing structures containing floating debris, new vessel construction yards where colorful particle streams become sleek starships. Sci-fi digital art, volumetric lighting, particle effects, detailed mechanical designs, atmospheric perspective, cinematic composition. Deep purple-magenta gradient background with violet accents and glowing particle trails.
