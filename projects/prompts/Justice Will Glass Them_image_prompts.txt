Here are the five detailed image generation prompts for Justice Will Glass Them:

Title Image: (16:9)
Wide-angle aerial shot from above showing a sleek angular space warship hovering menacingly in dark atmosphere above a sprawling fortified underground complex with visible surface installations and concrete bunkers. The ship's hull gleams with metallic panels and glowing engine arrays, positioned at dramatic three-quarter angle. Below, the fortress spreads across rocky terrain with defensive turrets and reinforced structures partially buried in layered earth and stone. Atmospheric haze and distance create depth between orbital vessel and terrestrial target. Cinematic sci-fi realism, dramatic lighting, industrial military aesthetic, high detail mechanical design, atmospheric perspective, moody shadows. Dark violet to crimson gradient sky with ember orange weapon glows and cool blue starlight accents.

Vignette Image: (16:9)
Close-up action shot capturing a brilliant violet-red energy beam drilling through cross-sectioned terrain layers, revealing distinct material strata of soil, concrete, and metal. The drilling beam creates shower of glowing particles and molten debris cascading downward. Camera positioned at side angle to show beam penetration depth through multiple fortress levels with visible air pockets and hidden chambers being exposed. Secondary beams and point defense fire streak across the frame creating dynamic action lines. Terrain chunks and melted material fall with realistic physics simulation. Cinematic sci-fi realism, dramatic lighting, industrial military aesthetic, high detail mechanical design, atmospheric perspective, moody shadows. Dark violet to crimson gradient background with ember orange drilling effects and cool blue defensive fire tracers.

Feature Image: (16:9)
Macro perspective focused on cascading sand and debris particles falling through exposed underground chambers with realistic physics simulation. Camera angle captures the mesmerizing flow of individual grains and chunks of destroyed fortress materials tumbling through carved-out caverns. Glowing ember particles mixed with darker soil create visual depth and motion trails. Background shows partially destroyed concrete walls and twisted metal supports with atmospheric lighting filtering through the destruction. The falling sand creates natural formations and accumulation patterns. Cinematic sci-fi realism, dramatic lighting, industrial military aesthetic, high detail mechanical design, atmospheric perspective, moody shadows. Dark violet chamber depths with ember orange glowing debris and cool blue atmospheric lighting filtering through.

Box Art Cover: (2:3)
Dramatic low-angle hero shot of imposing space warship silhouetted against turbulent sky with orbital vengeance theme composition. The vessel dominates the frame with angular aggressive design, visible weapon arrays, and engine glow creating intimidating presence. Background features dark cosmic void transitioning to planetary atmosphere with distant surface targets barely visible below. Dynamic lighting emphasizes the ship's threatening profile while energy effects and atmospheric disturbance suggest imminent justice delivery. Focus on powerful vertical composition befitting cover art format. Cinematic sci-fi realism, dramatic lighting, industrial military aesthetic, high detail mechanical design, atmospheric perspective, moody shadows. Dark violet cosmic void transitioning to hellish crimson lower atmosphere with ember orange engine and weapon glows.

Story Overworld Image: (16:9)
Expansive establishing shot showing multiple colonial worlds scattered across starfield with orbital enforcement vessels patrolling between planets. Wide-angle deep space perspective captures the scale of galactic authority operations. Several worlds visible with different atmospheric colors and surface features, connected by patrol routes and communication networks. Space stations and orbital platforms dot the void while sleek warships maintain surveillance positions. The composition emphasizes the vast scope of justice enforcement across inhabited systems. Distant nebulae and star clusters provide cosmic backdrop. Cinematic sci-fi realism, dramatic lighting, industrial military aesthetic, high detail mechanical design, atmospheric perspective, moody shadows. Deep violet cosmic background with crimson planetary atmospheres and ember orange orbital facility lighting.

Unified Art Style (for all five, already included in prompts):
Cinematic sci-fi realism, dramatic lighting, industrial military aesthetic, high detail mechanical design, atmospheric perspective, moody shadows. Dark violet to crimson gradient background with ember orange glowing effects and cool blue accent lighting.
