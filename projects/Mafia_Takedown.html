            <h2>📜 Lore & Story</h2>
            <div class="overview-text">
                <p><strong>Metro Babylon</strong> - once a symbol of progress and prosperity, now a sprawling metropolis rotting from within. Three decades of unchecked corporate power have transformed the city into a feudal state where criminal organizations operate as shadow governments, each claiming territory through intimidation and violence.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The System Has Failed.</strong> Police departments have been systematically defunded and corrupted. Courts serve the highest bidder. Politicians auction their votes to the most generous campaign contributors. The legitimate economy has withered as organized crime infiltrates every sector - construction, waste management, transportation, hospitality, even healthcare.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Corporate Towers and Crime Families</strong> divide the city between them. In the gleaming financial district, white-collar criminals launder billions through shell companies and offshore accounts. In the industrial sectors, traditional mob families control shipping ports and manufacturing. In the sprawling suburbs, street gangs push drugs and run protection rackets while corrupt police look the other way.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>What's at Stake:</strong> The soul of an entire generation. Children grow up believing that corruption is normal, that violence is the only language of power, that honest work is for suckers. Small business owners pay tribute to multiple crime families just to keep their doors open. Families live in fear, neighborhoods decay, and hope dies one extorted payment at a time.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>But Heroes Still Rise.</strong> In this urban wasteland, ordinary people occasionally reach their breaking point. A shopkeeper whose family is threatened. A teacher whose students are being recruited by gangs. A veteran who came home to find their community destroyed by drugs and corruption. When the system offers no justice, some decide to create their own.</p>
                <br>
                <p>These impromptu vigilantes rarely survive their first mission. But their sacrifice inspires others. A fallen hero's brother picks up the fight. A neighbor who witnessed their courage finds unexpected strength. Word spreads through encrypted messaging apps and underground networks - someone is finally fighting back.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The War Has Begun.</strong> Not between armies or nations, but between organized evil and disorganized good. Between those who profit from suffering and those who refuse to accept it. Every campaign represents one small corner of the city where ordinary people decided they'd had enough.</p>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h4>1. Moment-to-Moment Combat</h4>
                    <p>Physics-driven ragdoll battles where players maneuver their vigilante through microgravity arenas, strategically colliding with criminal opponents to systematically remove their armor, weapons, and limbs. Every impact creates realistic knockback and recoil forces that skilled players can exploit for positioning advantages.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h4>2. Mission Campaigns (Low Metagame)</h4>
                    <p>Procedurally generated gauntlets of 5-15 arena battles against specific criminal organizations. Each campaign represents one vigilante's complete mission to dismantle a crime syndicate. Success means the organization is destroyed forever; failure means the vigilante dies and a new hero must attempt the same mission from the beginning.</p>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h4>3. City-Wide Legacy (High Metagame)</h4>
                    <p>An endless cycle of vigilante heroism where successful missions are commemorated in a Hall of Fame, while fallen heroes inspire new champions from their community - family members, friends, activists, and strangers motivated by the original vigilante's sacrifice. Each new hero brings different equipment and fighting styles.</p>

                    <h3>⚔️ Legacy Campaign (Default)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Core Experience:</strong> The main mode where players tackle procedurally generated criminal organizations with permadeath consequences. When a vigilante falls, their story ends but inspires a new hero to continue the fight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Session Length:</strong> Variable campaigns (5-15 battles) with natural stopping points. Perfect for both quick tactical sessions and extended justice-dealing marathons.</p>

            <div class="feature-grid">
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>🎯 Strategic Ragdoll Physics Combat</h4>
                    <p>Combat centers on realistic collision-based interactions where every body part, armor piece, and weapon has individual hit points and physics properties. Players must carefully position their ragdoll vigilante to strike opponents' weak points while protecting their own vulnerable areas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Collision Dynamics:</strong> Every impact generates knockback and recoil forces that experienced players learn to chain together for devastating combination attacks. Weapon-to-weapon collisions damage both items without harming characters, while body-to-body impacts hurt both parties equally.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Tactical Dismemberment:</strong> Victory comes through systematic removal of opponent capabilities - destroying armor to expose vulnerable limbs, dismembering weapon-holding hands, or landing precise headshots. Each lost limb fundamentally changes combat dynamics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>🛡️ Improvised Equipment System</h4>
                    <p>Vigilantes fight with civilian-grade and makeshift weapons: kitchen knives, baseball bats, stolen police batons, improvised armor from construction materials, and scavenged gang weapons. Everything has limited durability and may break mid-battle.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Equipment Properties:</strong> Each item has unique weight, damage, durability, and physics characteristics. Heavy weapons hit harder but reduce mobility, while light weapons offer speed at the cost of stopping power. Armor pieces provide protection but add weight and bulk.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Scavenging System:</strong> Players constantly acquire new gear from defeated enemies and arena spawns, forcing rapid adaptation to new fighting styles. A crowbar-wielding vigilante might finish the battle dual-wielding switchblades after their original weapon breaks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>💀 Meaningful Death & Legacy System</h4>
                    <p>When a vigilante falls, they stay dead - no respawning, no retries, no time rewind. Instead, their sacrifice motivates someone from their community to take up the fight: family members, friends, coworkers, or inspired strangers who witnessed the original hero's courage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Replacement Heroes:</strong> Each new vigilante brings different equipment, fighting styles, and personal motivation. A fallen college student might be replaced by their vengeful father with military training, or a determined friend with different weapon preferences.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Memorial System:</strong> Successful campaigns are recorded with the names of all heroes who contributed to victory, while fallen heroes are remembered in a graveyard of noble sacrifices. Every death has permanent meaning and consequence.</p>

                    <h4>🏢 Dynamic Criminal Organizations</h4>
                    <p>Each campaign targets a procedurally generated crime syndicate with unique identity: organization name, base locations, member types, equipment preferences, and criminal specialties. No two campaigns face identical opposition.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Organization Variety:</strong> Fight corporate corruption in glass office towers, street gangs in warehouse districts, or mob operations in underground clubs. Each organization type brings different enemy configurations, environmental hazards, and tactical challenges.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Procedural Opposition:</strong> Enemy loadouts and battle scenarios are generated using intelligent heuristics that ensure challenging but fair encounters. Organizations might specialize in heavy weapons, defensive tactics, or overwhelming numbers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>🌆 Urban Combat Environments</h4>
                    <p>Battle through corporate boardrooms, underground parking garages, penthouse offices, back-alley hideouts, and abandoned warehouses. Each arena includes environmental hazards, item spawn points, and destructible elements that affect combat flow.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Environmental Storytelling:</strong> Arena design reflects the criminal organization's nature and operations. Drug labs have chemical hazards, corporate offices feature security systems, while gang hideouts contain improvised fortifications and weapon caches.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Dynamic Arenas:</strong> Mid-battle events can alter combat: security alarms triggering reinforcements, structural damage changing arena layout, or crowd interference throwing items into the fight. Players must adapt to evolving battlefield conditions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h4>⚖️ Justice Achievement System</h4>
                    <p>Every successfully dismantled criminal organization is permanently recorded with details of the campaign: which heroes participated, how many battles were fought, what final victory looked like. Failed campaigns honor fallen heroes while documenting the organization that remains active.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Hall of Fame:</strong> Browse past victories like newspaper archives, complete with screenshots of final victories and lists of heroes who contributed to each organization's downfall. Successful vigilantes retire to live happily ever after.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Ongoing Motivation:</strong> The persistent record of active criminal organizations provides clear goals and motivation. Players can see which syndicates remain operational and choose their next target based on personal preference or tactical considerations.</p>

            <h2>🎭 Design Trivia</h2>
            <p><strong>Vigilante Fiction Inspiration:</strong> Drawing from gritty urban hero stories like <em>Kick-Ass</em>, <em>Sin City</em>, and <em>The Punisher</em>, the game explores what happens when ordinary people decide to fight organized crime with improvised weapons and determination.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Physics-First Design:</strong> Every game mechanic emerges from realistic ragdoll physics and collision detection. No artificial health bars or damage multipliers - everything works through consistent physical interactions that players can learn and master.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Meaningful Consequence Philosophy:</strong> Inspired by classic roguelikes, the game rejects save-scumming and quick-loading in favor of permanent consequences that create genuine emotional weight. Every decision matters because every result is permanent.</p>
